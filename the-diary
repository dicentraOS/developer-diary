some context...

so, since 2013 I've been trying to get into the developer world with the core motive of data analytics and app development.
unfortunately though, i wasn't really able to memorize lines of code or think critically about what i was writing, hence
why development over the years since became a lot more difficult since you need a bit of a knack towards how you
fluently develop proper software for any means. 

i tried learning microsoft's c++ back in 2013, and kept re-visiting the language until 2019 where i wanted to develop an 
actual game. i even rented out a book at my old university, and well, i winded up paying late fees for the book rather than 
making the game. speaking of games though, i did make some stuff in unity, some friend of mine took credit for it and i literally 
had to ask him to put my name in. so, long story short, i don't enjoy game development, nor do i really like app development as
a whole.

but what i will say is, around 2023, i began to develop an obsession over jailbreaking and tampering with smartphones. my first
challenge was the samsung galaxy j4, and it failed miserably, after a year of trying. why? well, the telegram community from
indonesia was there to actually help me jailbreak it, but thanks to samsung's tight security, i wasn't able to do it and so
i gave the phone away. worser yet, i even burned some cash over the xiaomi redmi 7, as XDA forums told me it was a good
phone to jailbreak. it didn't work out either, the phone was faulty, so yeah, never buy anything from aliexpress that's a phone.

here i am today, and now i've jailbroken my google pixel 6a, and i plan to develop it as a prototype for what will eventually
become dicentraOS. i know some basic command prompt code, but apart from that, i'm usually going to use some AI to help me
to develop the core prototype. that's not until i get money from somewhere, and actually hire a team to develop the software
under my direction. so yeah, that's the dream, but i hope you got something from my story enough to follow me through.

be sure to follow my gitub for more updates, or if you genuinely want to help out or ask me questions, just shoot me an
email seen under my bio.

okay, cya :)
